		<h1>Every Woman in the World</h1>
	<hr/>
	
	<p>Every night seems, dinner and wine</br>
	Saturdays, girls</br>
	I was never in love, never had the time</br>
	In my hustle and hurried world</br>
	Laughing my self to sleep, waking up lonely</br>
	I needed someone to hold me, oh</p>
	
	<p>It's such a crazy home town</br>
	It can drag you down</br>
	Till you run out of dreams</br>
	So you party all night to the music and lights</br>
	But you don't what happiness means</br>
	I was dancing in the dark with strangers</br>
	When suddenly you found me, oh</p>
	
	<p>[Chorus]</p>
	
	Girl, you're every woman in the world to me</br>
	You're my fantasy, you're my reality</br>
	Girl, you're every woman in the world to me</br>
	You're everything I need, you're everything to me</br>
	Oh girl</p>
	
	<p>Everything good, everything fine</br>
	That's what you are</br>
	So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb</br>
	As high as the highest star</br>
	I'm living the life time in every minute</br>
	That we're together</br>
	And I'm staying right here forever, oh</p>
	
	<p>[Chorus]</p>
	
	<p>Girl, you're every woman in the world to me</br>
	You're my fantasy, you're my reality</br>
	Girl, you're every woman in the world to me</br>
	You're everything I need, you're everything to me</br>
	Oh girl</p>
